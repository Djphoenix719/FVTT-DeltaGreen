// Marionette
// Foot soldiers of Carcosa
// STR 10 CON 20 DEX 10 INT 10 POW 10
// HP 15 WP 10
// ARMOR: See METAL AND PORCELAIN.
//     ATTACKS: Impale 35%, Lethality 10%, Armor Piercing 2
// (see SWARM AND SPIKE).
// ENDLESS EXITS: Marionettes are impossible to trap.
//     Placing one in a room or a box or even burying
// it underground fails to contain it. The moment it is
// unobserved, it returns to Carcosa to continue its work.
//     IMPOSSIBLE GEARS: The construction of each marionette
// is unique and impossible. Anyone examining its
// machinery loses 0/1D4 SAN from the unnatural as
//     they realize it is powered by nothing. Those with Craft
// (Mechanics) at 30%+ or who make a successful roll at
// +20% automatically lose 4 SAN from the unnatural and
// gain +1 Corruption. It should not be able to move at all.
//     METAL AND PORCELAIN: Beneath the costume, each
// marionette is made of metal and porcelain. An attack
// on a marionette that rolls an odd amount of damage
// or with an odd-numbered Lethality roll inflicts only 1
// damage. There is an endless army of marionettes to
// replace any that might be destroyed.
//     SWARM AND SPIKE: To attack, marionettes swarm a
// target and make single impale attack roll. The victim
// can attempt to Dodge or fight back, as usual. If the
// victim loses, they are surrounded and treated as
//     pinned. If the victim is pinned when the marionettes
// next act, the victim suffers a Lethality 10% roll as the
// swarm releases dozens of spring-loaded spikes into the
// victimâ€™s body.
//     SANITY LOSS: 0/1D4 SAN from the unnatural, or 1/1D6
// SAN if the marionette was known in life.
